# Stock Pattern Matching

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of real-time stock market prediction using pattern matching techniques. By identifying recurring patterns in historical stock data, the model aims to predict future price movements with a reasonable degree of accuracy.


### Key Features

* **Real-time Data Ingestion:** The system will continuously stream live stock market data from reliable sources.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Advanced pattern recognition algorithms will be employed to identify recurring trends, anomalies, and correlations within the data.
* **Machine Learning Model:** A machine learning model, possibly a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, will be trained on historical data to learn from the identified patterns.
* **Prediction Generation:** Based on the learned patterns and real-time data, the model will generate predictions regarding future price movements.
* **Visualization:** A dashboard or visualization tool will be developed to provide a clear and intuitive representation of the model's predictions, historical data, and other relevant metrics.

### Technical Approach

* **Data Acquisition:** Utilize APIs or web scraping techniques to obtain real-time stock data from exchanges like NASDAQ, NYSE, or the London Stock Exchange.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize the data to ensure consistency and remove noise.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the raw data, such as moving averages, standard deviations, and technical indicators.
* **Model Development:** Train a suitable machine learning model on the preprocessed data, considering factors like model complexity, training time, and prediction accuracy.
* **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and accuracy.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model to a real-time environment for continuous prediction.
